## My process

### üõ†Ô∏è Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

üß© Code Highlights for me

```css
.container .social-links .socials li a {
    background-color: var(--grey-soft);
    color: var(--white);
    padding: 12px 85px;
    font-size: 12px;
    font-weight: 700;
    border-radius: 5px;
    transition: 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

.container .social-links .socials li a:hover {
    background-color: var(--green);
    color: #000000;
}
```

### üß† Continued development

I plan to keep improving my Flexbox skills, as I feel there‚Äôs still a lot of room for growth, especially when it comes to positioning images and centering elements within cards or containers.
